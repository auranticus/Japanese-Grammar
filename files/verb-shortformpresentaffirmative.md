## Uses of the Dictionary Form

### Casual Conversation/Plain Speech
When close friends, colleagues, family etc. are talking to one another, they will most frequently use plain speech (as opposed to more formal language when talking to strangers, superiors or new acquaintances). In this case, the dictionary form is used as the present and future affirmative form of the verb.
